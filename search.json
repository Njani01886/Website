    "text": "I am currently a Data Analytics and Computational Social Science Masters student at UMass Amherst with a passion for solving complex problems that improve business decisions and lives of other people. I have always been intrigued by the power of data, and pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Analytics has allowed me to explore this field in depth.\nThroughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve developed strong skills in data analysis, statistics, and machine learning, and I’m always eager to learn new techniques and tools to better serve my clients. I’ve worked on projects ranging from predictive modeling for housing markets to social media sentiment analysis, and I enjoy using my skills to find insights and patterns that can inform decision-making and drive positive change.\nAdditionally, I have completed several projects that required me to collect, clean, and analyze large sets of data, which provided me with hands-on experience with data cleaning and scraping, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation using tools such as SQL, R, and Python. My previous internship at Bora, a startup company, enabled me to work with a variety of stakeholders, providing me with experience in working collaboratively, which I believe is essential for success.\nAs a person, I’m motivated by a desire to help others. I believe that data can be a powerful force for improving the quality of life of any individual, and I’m committed to using my skills to help businesses and individuals achieve their goals. Whether I’m working on a complex analysis or brainstorming ideas with colleagues, I always strive to be supportive, empathetic, and collaborative, and I enjoy working with people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. I’m excited to be part of the next generation of data professionals who will make a positive impact in the world.\nIf you’re interested in connecting with me or learning more about my work, please don’t hesitate to reach out."

More specifically, I looked into certain meta learners that can estimate the conditional average treatment effect so that we can personalize treatment regimes. Here at Umass I hope to learn more about how to apply data science to medical treatments for people with illnesses."
